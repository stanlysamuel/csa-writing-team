<p>CSA Writing Team (CWT) was started with an intention to bridge the gap between researchers, professors, scientists and prospective students who may not be familiar with a lot of research areas. We aim to simplify ideas and concepts to the target audience who may not be confortable with a lot of technical jargon, such as first year engineering students. The audience is not just limited to fresh students but also to students currently pursuing research within CSA as well as other institutions. Themes surrounding computer science research, problems, solutions and the like are encouraged.</p>
